Javascript developer challenge
The company has all the employeeâ€™s information in a .txt file and they want to create a small
SPA that consumes an API that makes the .txt easy to read.

In order to do that they want to implement the next actions:
- It should be possible to list all the employees: It should have pagination, sort by name and
surname and filter by email.
- It should be possible to create a new employee.
- It should be possible to see only one employee.
All the actions must be implemented in the front, that communicates using API REST with
the backend. The backend will use the .txt file as database.
Requirements:
- The server side should be done in node.js.
- Typescript should be used.
- Choose in both (backend and frontend) the frameworks you feel more comfortable, it
is not expected that you write everything by your own, better that you use the tools
you prefer to make it easy and simple (also styling, do not need to write your own
framework in this task).
You can share a git repository with us, or share the project in the way you prefer.

The file attached follows the next format: id, name surname, address, phone, email,
birthdate.
```
